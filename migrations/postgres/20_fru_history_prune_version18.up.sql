-- Adds pruning function for existing hardware history tables of redundant events.

BEGIN;

-- For each unique comp_id grab the earliest event to use as a 'base' event. Then
-- compare the other events (in time order) to the base event for matching fru_id.
-- If the fru_id matches, delete it. If the fru_id doesn't match, keep the event
-- and set it as the new base event. This removes all except the 1st occurrence of
-- a hardware history event indicating a change.
